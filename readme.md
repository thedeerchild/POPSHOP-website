# Common Tasks

## Adding a Steering Committee Member or Alumni

Add the person's photo and name to the "partners" section, and add their biography information in the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnPxd5MoDKC8dEhETDdWcXh5Z0tPWkhMV1UwME9jc1E).

## Making Colored Things

The stripes in the header, footer and background are:

*   Green: 
    *   RGB: 000 255 001
    *   Hex: #00ff01
*   Pink:
    *   RGB: 255 000 114
    *   Hex: #ff0072
*   Blue: 
    *   RGB: 002 172 255
    *   Hex: #02acff

The red in the links and buttons is standard Cornell Red (Carnellian): 

*   RGB: 179 027 027
*   Hex: #b31b1b

## Editing Javascript

If you're looking for the typical `$(document).ready()` at the bottom of `index.html`, you're in for a surprise.  Add jQuery in `app.js`, then compress it and and append to `app.min.js` using [this JS compressor](http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home).

## Anything Else

Feel free to email me at elm232 'at' (standard Cornell email scheme) or message me on Github if you have any questions.
